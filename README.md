# Image Filters

Adding image filters in a background image using CSS "filter" property and background gradient overlays.

## Synopsis

Selecting an image to be your site's background can be a tough task. An impressive photo is always a nice thing to have, 
but at the same time having too much detail or being way too shiny will result in distracting your visitors' attention
from the site content.

CSS is set to support some presets that use popular modifications that usually work for most images, just by changing the
class of the overlay divider. These presets include blurring, darkening / brightening the image, a combination of the above?
and even some instagram-like "vintage" effects.

## Getting Started

Use the "Overlay Options" panel on your left side of the screen to view the image filters live on this demo site.
(Click on the cog icon if the panel is closed).

"Darken" cannot be combined with any of the presets.

## Compatibility Issues

Only partial compatibility in IE 9/10/11.
